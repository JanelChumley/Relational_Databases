For our project we only chose one dataset https://community.tableau.com/docs/DOC-1236, a Superstore sales record. The dataset
was published by Tableau, and comes in a xlsx format which we easily converted to csv. One reason we chose specific attributes,
such as locational columns and product information, is so that we could discover patterns between product sales and client locations.
One challenge with working with this data will be creating a complete product directory that can be used for reference in all customer orders.
